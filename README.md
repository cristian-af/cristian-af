Hey, I’m Christian
I am a Romanian guy who was likes to play games and is interested in technology. I gave up coding and I do not know when I will begin coding again.

All my past projects are **discontinued**. I will not take any responsibility for any error or something in my archived projects. You're free to read (and maybe take) the code.
