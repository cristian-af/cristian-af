Hey, Iâ€™m octavian. You might know me also by Cristian.
I am a Romanian guy who was likes to play games and is interested in technology. I gave up coding, and I do not know when I will begin coding again. You will see that I am not that active on github anymore.

All my past projects are **discontinued**. I will not take any responsibility for any error or something in my archived projects. You're free to read (and maybe take) the code.

- I am rewritting it for someone else and I decided to put the original repo private to use it. Sorry!
